# Pynta

``pynta`` is an automated workflow code to enable the calculation of thermochemistry
and rate coefficients for reactions involving metallic surfaces.

The ``pynta`` code is designed to automatically characterize chemical reactions
relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, it spawns and processes a
large number of ab initio quantum chemistry calculations to study gas-phase
reactions on crystal facets. It is designed to run both on local clusters and
on petascale and upcoming exascale machines.

Pynta generates initial guesses for all gas phase species and adsorbates on the surface accounting
for the symmetry of the surface. These guesses are then optimized and frequencies are calculated for
the unique resulting geometries. Based on the provided reaction semi-atom mappings the
adsorbate are placed on the surface and perturbed in many unique ways to generate
transition state guesses, the best guesses are optimized and vibrational frequencies
and IRCs are generated for unique successfully optimized transition states. This
information can then be processed to generate thermochemistry and rate coefficients
for the adsorbates and reactions that can be used in microkinetic models.

Pynta is designed to work with the workflow code
[Fireworks](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/), which provides users
with significant flexiblity in running Pynta.
